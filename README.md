# Harvard-MIT Mathematics Tournament Projects

This is a place where all the software I write for the tournament will live. As a tournament director, I don't get to write as much software as I would like, but there's always time for a fun project here and there.

## Required Packages

* `personalized_schedules`: `pylatex`
* `assign_rooms`: `selenium` (which itself requires a driver: current assumption is that the user has Google Chrome)
